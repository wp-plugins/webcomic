= ★ New in Webcomic 4 ★ =

[_**Everything!**_](//github.com/mgsisk/webcomic/wiki) Webcomic has been rebuilt to provide you with leaner, meaner webcomic management. Highlights include:

- [OpenGraph](http://ogp.me) and [Twitter Card](http://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) support for any Webcomic-related page.
- [Twitter](http://twitter.com) integration for automatically tweeting new webcomics.
- [Touch gestures](http://github.com/mgsisk/webcomic/wiki/Touch-Gestures) for webcomic navigation.
- [File management](http://github.com/mgsisk/webcomic/wiki/Media) handled through the WordPress Media Library.
- Each [collection](http://github.com/mgsisk/webcomic/wiki/Webcomic-Collections) is now a custom post type with unique [storyline](http://github.com/mgsisk/webcomic/wiki/Storylines) and [character](http://github.com/mgsisk/webcomic/wiki/Characters) taxonomies.
- [More](http://github.com/mgsisk/webcomic/wiki/General-Settings) [collection](http://github.com/mgsisk/webcomic/wiki/Transcript-Settings)-[specific](http://github.com/mgsisk/webcomic/wiki/Commerce-Settings) [settings](http://github.com/mgsisk/webcomic/wiki/Access-Settings) [provide](http://github.com/mgsisk/webcomic/wiki/Post-Settings) [greater](http://github.com/mgsisk/webcomic/wiki/Permalink-Settings) [control](http://github.com/mgsisk/webcomic/wiki/Twitter-Settings) over each webcomic on your site.
- [Transcripts](http://github.com/mgsisk/webcomic/wiki/Transcripts) are now a custom post type, taking full advantage of the administrative features WordPress provides.
- Improved [theme integration](http://github.com/mgsisk/webcomic/wiki/Configuring) makes it easier than ever to start using Webcomic right away with almost any WordPress theme.
- New and refactored [template tags, shortcode](http://github.com/mgsisk/webcomic/wiki/Template-Tags-and-Shortcodes), and [widgets](http://github.com/mgsisk/webcomic/wiki/Widgets) for greater control and customization of your Webcomic-powered site.
